SparkFun ADC Block for Edison C++ Library
========================================

SparkFunâ€™s ADC Block for the Intel Edison allows you to add four channels of 
I2C controlled ADC input to your Edison stack. These four channels can be 
used as single-ended inputs, or in pairs as differential inputs. A ground 
reference is provided for each channel.

The maximum resolution of the converters is 12 bits, or 11 bits bipolar in 
differential mode. Step sizes range from 125uV per count to 3mV per count.
